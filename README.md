# tf_kube_aws

This terraform module creates a kubernetes cluster in AWS. It assumes [ignition](https://coreos.com/ignition) userdata and it's designed to synergise well with [tf_kube_ignition](https://github.com/utilitywarehouse/tf_kube_ignition).

## Input Variables

The input variables are documented in their description and it's best to refer to [variables.tf](variables.tf).

## Ouputs

- `etcd_ip_list` - a list with the IP addresses of the created etcd nodes
- `cfssl_ip` - the IP address of the cfssl server that manages certificates
- `master_address` - the endpoint on which the kubernetes api is made available
- `etcd_security_group_id` - the id of the security group to which kubernetes etcd nodes belong
- `master_security_group_id` - the id of the security group to which kubernetes master nodes belong
- `worker_security_group_id` - the id of the security group to which kubernetes worker nodes belong

## Usage

Below is an example of how you might use this terraform module:

```hcl
module "aws_cluster" {
  source = "github.com/utilitywarehouse/tf_kube_aws"

  region                           = "eu-west-1"
  cluster_name                     = "example-kube"
  cluster_subdomain                = "k8s"
  vpc_id                           = "${aws_vpc.example.id}"
  containerlinux_ami_id            = "ami-xxxxxxxxx"
  route53_zone_id                  = "${aws_route53_zone.example.id}"
  route53_inaddr_arpa_zone_id      = "${aws_route53_zone.example-reverse.id}"
  control_plane_private_subnet_ids = "${aws_subnet.control_plane_private.*.id}"
  worker_node_private_subnet_ids   = "${aws_subnet.workers_private.*.id}"
  public_subnet_ids                = "${aws_subnet.public.*.id}"
  key_name                         = "${aws_key_pair.example.key_name}"
  ssh_security_group_ids           = ["${aws_security_group.ssh.id}"]
  cfssl_user_data                  = "${module.ignition.cfssl}"
  etcd_user_data                   = "${module.ignition.etcd}"
  master_user_data                 = "${module.ignition.master}"
  worker_user_data                 = "${module.ignition.worker}"
}
```
